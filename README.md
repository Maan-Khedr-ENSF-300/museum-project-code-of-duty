Features beyond the minimum requirements
        - Our program executes all required sql syntax given only the arbitrary user inputs as it accounts for the complete syntax on its own, making it user friendly
        - Almost all bonus material has been completed 
        
## Organization:
- code folder: contains your main python application code
- sql scripts folder: contains all sql scripts required (database creation and initialization, sql script with query tasks in the handout, etc...)
- database design folder: EERD and relational schema
- optional data folder: has data files that you can sue to load data to your application if you use this optional implementation requirement
